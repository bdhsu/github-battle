# Github Battle

Github Battle is a multipage webapp that fetches data via Ajax requests to Github API. Custom boilerplate using React, Webpack, Babel, react-router, and axios. Served using Firebase.

This is my implementation of the final project of **React Fundamentals**, a course which can be found [here](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/).

## Features

**Custom Boilerplate**: Custom NPM boiletplate using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), bundling via [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), and [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) as a compiler.

**Multipage**: Routing through [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)

**Instantaneous Data**: Data is fetched instantaneously via Ajax requests to the Github API using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

**Live Hosting**: Check out the live application as hosted using **Firebase** [HERE](https://github-wizard.firebaseapp.com/).

## Usage

Run `npm install` -> installs dependencies
Run `npm run start` -> starts a local instance of Webpack dev server
Go to `localhost:8080` to check out a locally hosted instance of **Github Battle**.
